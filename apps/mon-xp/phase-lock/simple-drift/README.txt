Here we design simple T-Mote Sky applications to test the drift parameter outside Contiki.
We then display the observed deviation as we do with the test-drift experiment.

To realize this XP we proceed in 4 steps:

 1) Just compile on T-Mote Sky (and LED blink?).
 2) Integrate the monitor with symlinks.
 3) Beacon deviation, analyse and show results as it is done in the test-drift XP.
 4) Try the same experiment with sleep machanisms.
